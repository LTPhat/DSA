AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. This difference is called the Balance Factor.
In order to perform this balancing, we perform ROTATIONs on the unbalanced/imbalanced Binary Search Tree to make it a AVL tree.
We peform 4 basic rotations depending of 4 difference cases -
1) Left Rotation
2) Right Rotation
3) Left Right Rotation
4) Right Left Rotation
